1. reversestring (LINEAR RUNTIME)
2. palindrome
3. reverseint
4. maxchar // Iterate an object by using 'let char in'
5. fizzbuzz
6. chunk
7. anagrams (likely to be asked)
8. capitalize
9. steps
10. pyramid
11. vowels
12.

Runtime complexity describes how performant an algorithm is.
    How much more processing power/time is required to run  your algorithm if we double/increase the inputs?
    reversestring (LINEAR RUNTIME because it had one basic for loop aka 1-to-1 relationship between amount work to do versus the input)
    steps had more than one for loop and were nested, which is N^N(quadratic runtime)
    NEVER suggest exponential time for Determining Complexity. 

Memoization can dramatically increase performance for recursion code. 
It avoids calling the same function multiple times with the same set of arguments each time.

Queue Class uses an array
